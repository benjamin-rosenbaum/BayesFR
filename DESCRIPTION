Description: Easy application of Bayesian inference for functional responses via brms. This package allows to fit various FR models for single- and multi-prey experiments. It uses dynamical prediction models to correct for prey depletion. The brms framework facilitates statistical modelling and enables users to conveniently incorporate covariates such as temperature gradients, experimental treatment variables, or random effects that account for grouping in experimental units. Default brms functions make it easy to perform model checking, model comparisons and hypothesis testing. Potential statistical issues with data from feeding trials, such as overdispersion or zero inflation, can be resolved by effortlessly switching between likelihood functions. The BayesFR package, together with its tutorials, should provide students and researchers with a comprehensive and integrated statistical framework for easily testing their hypotheses on trophic interactions.
